It allows running Kubernetes conformance testing, Partner and OSS add-on deployment and validation on EKS-A environments and helps Partners validate their hardware (IHV) and software (ISV) solutions deployed on variety of EKS environments.</p> <p>\ud83c\udfaf This repository is a GitOps repository powered by FluxCD and contains Partner and third-party solutions and functional tests for deployment in the supported deployment environments. Each deployment option is represented by the respective folder in this repository, where Partners and external contributors can submit a pull request.</p> <p>\ud83c\udfaf GitOps is leveraged as a decoupling mechanism between physical test environments and ISV solutions, enabling Partners to test their solutions without direct access to the respective labs and avoid potentially costly maintenance of the test environments.</p>"},{"location":"#getting-started","title":"\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0fGetting Started","text":"<p>Deployment of a third-party solution requires a PR for a FluxCD deployment submitted to this repository.</p> <p>\ud83d\ude80 The framework allows to submit your solution to a single location and deploy across all environments with the same configuration. In this case, create a new solution specific folder (e.g. <code>&lt;orgname&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;orgname&gt;/&lt;productname&gt;</code>) in the common folder eks-anywhere-common/Addons/Partner and submit your GitOps deployment (e.g. HelmRelease, manifests and/or other support package management resources) in that folder.</p> <p>\ud83d\ude80 If your product and/or configuration must be distinct for each of the deployment options then create a new solution under the respective target. For example, if it is for EKS-A on Snow then the path is <code>eks-anywhere-snow/Addons/Partner</code>.</p> <p>\ud83d\ude80 For kubernetes namespace resource for your product, please add labels as shown below for reporting purposes:</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n    name: kubecost\n    labels:\n        aws.conformance.vendor: kubecost\n        aws.conformance.vendor-solution: cost-analyzer\n        aws.conformance.vendor-solution-version: 2.0.2\n</code></pre> <p>\ud83d\ude80 You can deploy Helm via FluxCD HelmRelease custom resource. Here is a Helm example. In particular the example covers specification of Helm repository and Helm release.</p> <p>\ud83d\ude80 Secrets management such as license key or credentials is implemented using the External Secrets add-on. You will need to share secrets with the AWS Partner team. The AWS Partner team will create those secrets in an AWS account and use External Secrets to bring them down to the target deployment cluster. After that, such secrets can be configured in your GitOps deployment folder and passed to the deployment using configuration values or if your helm deployment can use pre-created secrets, that option is also supported.  The sample folder also contains an example of leveraging a secret with the deployment as well as an example of wiring that secret in your deployment here (line numbers may change in the link).</p> <p>\ud83d\ude80 Though deployment and validation of your solution on the target deployment option is helpful, it does not provide the required level of quality assurance for functional verification, which is generally achieved with a test framework and automation normally included in the CI/CD cycle of the Partner product.</p>"},{"location":"#functional-job-requirements","title":"Functional Job Requirements","text":"<ol> <li>Functional test should base its test cases on the specifications of the ISV product under test</li> <li>Functional test should validate the functionality of the ISV product and describe what the ISV product does</li> <li>Healthchecks, service endpoints checks or any other technical checks do not represent sufficient coverage required for the functional test</li> <li>Functional test should be wrapped as a container, container image should be published on ECR, and/or provide evidence of successful recent vulnerability scan</li> <li>Functional test must be implemented as a Kubernetes CronJob and any non-zero exit status of the job execution will be considered a failure</li> <li>Functional test must be repeatable.

You can use the following command for example to verify that a suitable kubeconfig file can be found and the cluster can be accessed. If no configuration is found you will get an error message indicating that \"http://localhost:8080/version\" cannot be accessed. Do not be confused by the port number.
